# 2018 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions.

This are the 2018 resolutions, go [here if you want to take a look at the 2017 resolutions](/archive/resolutions2017.md).

### 25 Online courses ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
2017 was a great year for learning new things but my expectations were a little high (30 courses), let's try with a little bit less than that.

### 10 Books ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
On 2017 I read 6/6 books (and a few more in progress), so, let's try to read a little bit more.

**Reading**

1. [Building Microservices][book1]
2. [Data and Goliat][book2]
3. [Hacking: The Art of Exploitation][book3]

### 2 Drawings ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Ok, last year I just got 1 here, let's try with 2 now.

### 1000 Github contributions ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year, not even the half of it, but I will keep the bar high here. I have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.

### 5 blog posts
Las year I completely forgot about this one (too busy?), let's try again.

### 1 Trip outside the country ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Ok, this year will be a little more difficult to acomplish this one.

### Weight 72,5 kg/160 lb
This one is hard, last year didn't make it. I never recovered my weight after my trip to Denver.
