# 2019 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions.

These are my 2019 resolutions. My goal is to hit 70-80% of them, specially cause I started the year burning my right foot so I can't do many of them until I get better. 

### Go to 15 surf trips ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Last year I surfed once a month, and it was amazing. Surfing gets the best out of me, I want to do it more often, so 15 times is a little more than once a month.   

Specific places I want to go surfing at:
- [ ] Sayulita 
- [ ] Acapulco 

### Run a 10Km Race ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
I recently discovered that I really enjoy listening to audiobooks while running. Makes running way more pleasant. I've never been able to run more than 6Km because I get bored really fast, so I want to test if training with audiobooks helps me run longer distances.
