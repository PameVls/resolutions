# 2017 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions. All numbers are just the minimum.

### 30 Online courses ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/4)
2016 was a great year for learning a lot of new things, let's keep up learning.

1. [Learn DevOps: Scaling apps On-Premise and in the Cloud][1] ([Certificate][2])

**Read**

1. [Web Development with Go: Building Scalable Web Apps and RESTful Services][book1]

**Reading**

1. [Building Microservices][book2]

### 1 Drawing
I liked drawing a long time ago. I would like to start again so let's start with one.

### 1000 Github contributions
Here is the magic. I have many things I want to code.
Entrepreneurship coding, contributing at open source projects and coding for fun are Ok. Coding at work doesn't count.
Originally I thought about tracking days coding per year but it is easier to track just the number of contributions since Github has a nice UI for this.

### 10 blog posts
