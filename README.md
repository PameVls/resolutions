# 2018 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions.

This are the 2018 resolutions, go [here if you want to take a look at the 2017 resolutions](/archive/resolutions2017.md).

### 25 Online courses ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/8)
2017 was a great year for learning new things but my expectations were a little high (30 courses), let's try with a little bit less than that.

1. [Introduction to Cybersecurity for Business](./certificates/Coursera%20Z8SX8AVLK4CE.pdf)
2. [Cyber Threats and Attack Vectors](./certificates/Coursera%20EUDCHQBK222Q.pdf)

### 10 Books ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/80)
On 2017 I read 6/6 books (and a few more in progress), so, let's try to read a little bit more.

1. [Go in Action][readbook1]
2. [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck][readbook2]
3. [The 10% Entrepreneur][readbook3]
4. [Hit Refresh][readbook4]
5. [Why we sleep][readbook5]
6. [Measure What Matters][readbook6]
7. [Culture Code][readbook7]
8. [Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility][readbook8]

2. [The DevOps Handbook][reading2]

**Temporarily abandoned**

1. [Building Microservices][abandoned1]
2. [Data and Goliat][abandoned2]
3. [Hacking: The Art of Exploitation][abandoned3]
4. [Creativity Inc.][abandoned4] (Reading it again because is such a great book and I love it, this time I am reading it slower, enjoying every word)

**About to read**

2. [Site Reliability Engineering][abouttoread2]

### 2 Drawings ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Ok, last year I just got 1 here, let's try with 2 now.

### 1000 Github contributions ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/26)
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year, not even the half of it, but I will keep the bar high here. I have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.

### 5 blog posts
Las year I completely forgot about this one (too busy?), let's try again.

### 1 Trip outside the country ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/100)
Ok, I just moved out of the country. I now live in Mexico, so I guess that counts.

### Weight 72,5 kg/160 lb
This one is hard, last year didn't make it. I never recovered my weight after my trip to Denver and I just moved to Mexico where there are a lot of delicious food options.
 - August 26, 2018: 83.3 kg
