# 2019 Resolutions
Just a convenient place to track my new year resolutions.

These are my 2019 resolutions. My goal is to hit 70-80% of them, specially cause I started the year burning my right foot so I can't do many of them until I get better. 

### Go to 15 surf trips ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Last year I surfed once a month, and it was amazing. Surfing gets the best out of me, I want to do it more often, so 15 times is a little more than once a month.    

### Run a 10Km Race ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
I recently discovered that I really enjoy listening to audiobooks while running. Makes running way more pleasant. I've never been able to run more than 6Km because I get bored really fast, so I want to test if training with audiobooks helps me run longer distances. 

### Read 25 Books ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
I love reading (obviously), but this time, there are some specific topic and title guidelines I'd love to establish. 

Specific titles I really want to read this year

### 1000 Github contributions ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
This doesn't mean too much but I will track it again just for fun. I didn't make it last year but I did more than 60%, so I'll keep the bar high here. I have plans to contribute more to the Open Source world. And here is [a nice UI][githubui] just to track this.

### 4 blog posts ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Las year I tried this one but all I got was one internal post. This year I'll try again at least with one post a quarter.

### 1 Trip outside the country ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
I'll keep this simple, just 1 trip, even when last year I traveled 4 times.

### 2 Drawings ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)
Last year I did not any progress here but I'd like to try again.

### Weight 72,5 kg/160 lb
This one is hard, but this is the year when I want to make more excersice and cook healtier at home. Let's see how it goes. 
 - December 31, 2018: 83.4 kg
